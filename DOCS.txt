Run `bun asm` to assemble src/assembler.js into out.sheet.

Parameters starting with & means they are memory addresses rather than the concrete value.
Parameters starting with % means they should be treated as the address itself in the normal
(constant variant), and as an &address in the "_a" (address) variant.

The prefix * implies reading the value at the memory address (dereferencing).
Memory addresses are in the form of row[col] since memory is 2D.

Unless otherwise specified, the program counter (PC) increments after every instruction.

lte &out &a &b
    If *a <= *b, stores 1 at out[0], otherwise stores 0.

add &out &a &b
    Stores the result of adding *a + *b at out[0].

load(_a) &out %row &col
    Read the value at (*row)[*col] and store it at out[0].
    Note that this reads the values at &row and &col and uses those values as the addresses.
    In the future it might be better for &row to be a concrete address instead of a reference.

store(_a) %row &col &in
    Store *in at (*row)[*col]. See load for further notes.

jmp0(_a) &data %dest
    If *data == 0, sets the PC to *dest, otherwise increments it as usual.

jmp(_a) %dest
    Sets the PC to *dest.

halt
    Stops the PC from increasing, halting the program's execution.
