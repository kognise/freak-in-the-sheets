Parameters starting with & means they are memory addresses rather than the concret value.
The prefix * implies reading the value at the memory address (dereferencing).
Memory addresses are in the form of row[col] since memory is 2D.

Unless otherwise specified, the program counter (PC) increments after every instruction.

<= &out &a &b
    If *a <= *b, stores 1 at out[0], otherwise stores 0.

add &out &a &b
    Stores the result of adding *a + *b at out[0].

load &out &row &col
    Read the value at (*row)[*col] and store it at out[0].
    Note that this reads the values at &row and &col and uses those values as the addresses.
    In the future it might be better for &row to be a concrete address instead of a reference.

store &row &col &in
    Store *in at (*row)[*col]. See load for further notes.

jmp0 &data &dest
    If *data == 0, sets the PC to *dest, otherwise increments it as usual.

jmp &dest
    Sets the PC to *dest.

halt
    Stops the PC from increasing, halting the program's execution.
